### Fundamentals of Data Storytelling

*What is Data Storytelling?*

Data storytelling is a powerful mechanism for sharing insights supported by a compelling narrative and efficient visualizations. Anecdotes stimulate people's imagination, and stories are more memorable than metrics, adding value by providing context to the data. Thanks to this, the audience can understand the insights, facilitating the decision-making process and, in turn, driving actions and changes.

*Elements of Data Storytelling:*
1. *Three-Minute Story:* The concept of a three-minute story challenges us to focus on essential elements if we only had three minutes to tell a story. It emphasizes brevity and clarity in communication.

2. *The Big Idea:* This concept encourages us to articulate the unique viewpoint of our story in a single sentence. It helps distill the core message, making it clear and concise.

*Three Central Elements for Any Data Story:*
1. *Insightful:* Derives clear learnings from the analysis.
2. *Explanatory:* Helps the audience understand the insights.
3. *Concise:* Presents only concrete and specific facts.

*Building an Effective Data Story:*
1. *Inclusion of Relevant Discoveries:* Include findings from models or analyses that apply to the situation. Base the story on accurate and reliable data, excluding unreliable results.

2. *Actionable Insights:* The story should always include actionable insights—data that drives action.

3. *Engaging Narrative:* A good data story comprises a compelling and easy-to-understand narrative, focusing on key points necessary for driving change.

4. *Central Theme:* While it may be tempting to include many disconnected facts, an effective narrative revolves around a central vision, considering the background and the target audience to clarify the facts for them.

5. *Linear Sequence:* Every data story follows a linear sequence, ensuring that all data points complement each other until the conclusion is reached. However, caution should be exercised to avoid including misleading charts.

Effective data storytelling involves crafting a narrative that is not only informative but also captivating, ensuring that the audience can comprehend and act upon the presented insights.

**Exercises:**

**The story begins**

You recently started working as a data scientist at a company named Communicatb. For your first project, you and your team need to analyze customer churn data for a cell phone company. The goal is to predict their behavior and help develop a program to retain customers.

Your team lead knows you are an expert on storytelling. She asks you to explain to the team why crafting a compelling story is important when delivering results. You write down a list of reasons to be prepared.

One of the statements you wrote is false. Can you select which one is it?

        "Even if your data do not reveal a distinct customer behavior, storytelling might influence stakeholders to create the retention program."

**Building a story**

You nailed it! Your explanation of why stories are efficient when conveying insights went very well! Now, your team lead would like you to give a short presentation. You're going to explain the different steps involved in telling a story with data to the team. It will be the starting point for delivering the results of the churn project when it's ready.

You know it is an important task. To prepare for your talk, you look for your notes on the storytelling course you took, but realize that some parts are erased. So you need to remember the do's and dont's of data storytelling.

Which of the following statements about effective data storytelling are true, and which are false?

**Instruction:**

- Correctly classify the statements as either true or false.

# Translating technical results

**Personal notes:**

### Translating Technical Results

*Understanding the Audience's Technical Proficiency:*

It's crucial to assess the technical proficiency of your audience. Simplifying this into technical and non-technical categories facilitates better comprehension. Technical knowledge exists on a continuum, and it's your responsibility to gauge your audience's technical proficiency. While data professionals may enjoy discussing methods, less technical audiences are generally concerned with outcomes and implications.

*ADEPT Technique:*

The ADEPT technique, recommended by Kalid Azad, can be highly valuable. Here's a breakdown of the ADEPT principles:

1. *Analogies:*
   - Use analogies to relate new concepts to things that your audience is already comfortable with and understands well. Analogies bridge the gap between unfamiliar technical terms and familiar concepts.

2. *Diagrams:*
   - Visual aids, such as diagrams, are essential to help your audience visualize complex ideas. Diagrams provide a clear and structured representation, aiding in understanding.

3. *Examples:*
   - Illustrative examples have powerful explanatory capabilities. Real-world examples or scenarios can make technical concepts more relatable and easier to grasp.

4. *Plain Language:*
   - Pay attention to the language you use. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon, and opt for plain language that is easily understood. Technical terms may not be familiar to everyone, especially in scenarios where you're presenting to non-data sectors.

5. *Technical to Non-Technical Translation:*
   - Consider how to translate technical results into a language that resonates with a non-technical audience. Focus on the broader implications and outcomes rather than diving deep into technical details.

By incorporating the ADEPT technique, you can enhance the effectiveness of your communication, ensuring that your message is accessible and impactful for audiences across varying levels of technical expertise.

**Exercises:**

**A non-tech story**

The exploratory data analysis on the churn project is finished! It's now time for the monthly update meeting. You will have to explain your results to the operation specialist and the program director. You are addressing a non-technical audience, and want to make sure that your presentation is adapted to the audience you're addressing so that your message gets across.

You write down some statements you could use to explain your work, but you believe some of them are more suitable for a non-technical story, while others are too technical to include.

Can you select which sentences you should use in this case?

**Instruction:**

- Correctly classify the examples as more suitable either for a tech or non-tech stories.

**Be aware**

The meeting was a success! The program director asks you to send your results to the business specialists. You need to write a report and send it by email by the end of the week. You have never met them, so you ask for their background and goals.

After you gather data, you realize you will be communicating your results to a different audience. You want them to understand your results.

Can you select which of the following examples are best practices to translate your results?

**Instruction:**

- Correctly classify the examples as either best practice or bad practice.

# Impacting the decision-making process

**Personal notes:**

*Compelling Narrative:*

After uncovering relevant insights in our data, it's crucial to present them meaningfully to our target audience. This involves crafting a compelling narrative that includes key points and facilitates change. In essence, we need a persuasive narrative that organizes information to engage the audience and make them care about the shared results or information.

*Narrative Structure:*

There are various narrative structures, but it all boils down to a framework that guides how we present our story. To initiate our data story, we should provide background details: insights into the problem that motivated the analysis, changes in the previous situation justifying an analysis, and who/what the analysis is focusing on.

After introducing the problem, evidence of contributing factors should be presented. However, only relevant information should be included, avoiding detailed data that might overwhelm the audience. Additional supporting evidence and data can be provided, helping to explain at a deeper level the root cause of the problem.

All evidence should lead to the climax: the moment when we introduce the central finding of our analysis. This should offer clear insights into what could happen if nothing is changed. Once the main discovery is revealed, we should conclude by exploring potential solutions and opportunities, recommending a course of action. Being proactive and guiding the audience through understanding what to do with our results is essential for impacting the decision-making process.

With these steps, we create a narrative that captures the interest of our audience.

*Building Narrative:*

During analysis, several observations can be made, leading to the construction of a narrative. This may involve examining how a variable changes over time or within a standard time cycle, focusing on relationships between two variables, or exploring similarities and differences among data groups. As we craft our narrative, it's crucial to ensure that these data points create a relevant and relatable story. The narrative should resonate with the audience and effectively convey the key messages derived from the analysis.

**Exercises:**
