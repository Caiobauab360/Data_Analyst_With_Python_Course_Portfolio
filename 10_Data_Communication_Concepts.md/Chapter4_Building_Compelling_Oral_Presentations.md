# Planning an oral presentation

**Personal notes:**

To structure the presentation effectively, it's crucial to consider the purpose, the audience, and the message you want to convey.

*Purpose:*

Define the purpose of your presentation based on its type:
- *Informative Presentation:* Providing information on current negative and positive ratings and associated words.
- *Instructive Presentation:* Explaining how the analysis model was constructed.
- *Persuasive Presentation:* Convincing stakeholders to take actions to address high numbers of negative reviews.

*Audience:*

Consider your audience, whether they are technical colleagues, managers, executives, or clients. Also, think about the size of the audience, whether it's a small team meeting or a large conference.

*Message:*

Identify the key message you want your audience to remember. Craft a compelling opening statement, focus on a central message (preferably a single sentence), and end with a closing statement that reinforces the central message.

*Structure:*

Based on the purpose, audience, and message, structure your presentation. Start with an introduction, providing essential information to grab the audience's attention. Then, delve into methods, analysis, and model results, adjusting the level of technical detail based on the audience. Finally, conclude by revisiting the introduction and adding a call-to-action or recommendations for next steps.

*Outline:*

Create an outline with about five sections to maintain audience engagement:
1. *Reason for Analysis*
2. *Exploratory Analysis*
3. *Sentiment Analysis*
4. *Conclusion*
5. *Recommended Actions*

Consider the time available for the presentation, as it will influence the planning and pacing of the content delivery.

# Building presentation slides

**Personal notes:**

Creating effective slides is essential to support the narrative you're conveying. Consider your audience's attention span, aiming for dynamic presentations with concise content on each slide. Each slide should carry a single message to maintain clarity and engagement.

*Color:*

- Use a minimal color palette necessary to convey your message.
- Ensure good contrast between text and background for readability.
- Be mindful of colorblind individuals to avoid issues with color distinction.

*Fonts:*

- Choose fonts that enhance readability.
- Keep text short and use larger fonts.
- Limit font styles and sizes to convey the message without distraction.

*Text Slide:*

- Avoid excessive text; focus on key points.
- Include a concise and specific slide title to capture attention.
- Use bullet points or stratification to break down complex information.

*Visualization Slide:*

- Replace text-heavy slides with visuals like graphs or charts.
- Introduce visual elements sequentially to guide the audience through the information.
- Highlight specific aspects of visuals to emphasize key points.
- Use only one or two full-sized graphs per slide to avoid information overload.

Remember, slides are a support tool for your presentation, not standalone documents. Keep them visually appealing, concise, and aligned with your spoken words to enhance overall comprehension.

**Exercises:**

**A color building**

You have planned the presentation for your findings on software development sector salaries for San Francisco employees. Now, it's time to build the slides. After putting your slide deck together, you ask your coworker to give you feedback. She makes comments on the different slides.

You start by reviewing the following graph slide.

One of the comments she wrote about the slide is not correct. Can you select which one it is?

        "The headline looks stylish. Even though the spacing between the letters is small, the font adds originality to the slide."

**Too much text**

Your coworker also gives you feedback on slides that only have text. She feels like the slide can be improved a lot. She gives you some options on how you can improve the slide.

One of the following statements is not correct. Can you select which one is it?

       "Highlight the keywords in the text using red, green, yellow, blue, and magenta. Using several colors will help catch the audience's attention." 

**The right building**

Well done building a text slide! Now, you need to review the rest of the comments from your coworker. She left you the feedback in two stacks of notes: one stack for best practices and one stack for what you should avoid. However, the stacks fell during your lunch break and are all mixed up.

Can you classify which of the following comments are best practice in building a presentation, and which ones should be avoided?

**Instruction:**

- Correctly classify the comments as either best practices or practices to avoid.

# Delivering the presentation

**Personal notes:**

*Practice:*

Practicing is crucial for a successful presentation. Draft a script, not to memorize it, but to guide an efficient articulation of thoughts and insights. Frequent practice helps you become more familiar with the content, identify distracting patterns, and refine your delivery. Anticipate and prepare responses for potential follow-up questions. Rehearse in a setup close to the presentation context, using real slides, speaking aloud, and addressing possible inquiries.

*Deliver the Presentation:*
1. *Emotional Awareness:*
   - Be conscious of your emotions as the audience can perceive them.
   - Confidence in your delivery builds trust in your content.

2. *Attention Span:*
   - Audience attention typically ranges from 5 to 20 minutes.
   - Employ strategies like eye contact, interactivity, and questions to engage the audience.
   - Speak with them, not at them, fostering a connection and empathy.

3. *Language and Tone:*
   - Choose language carefully, avoiding phrases that may alienate or confuse.
   - Refrain from phrases like "As we know" or "obviously" to maintain a connection.

4. *Timing:*
   - Stay within the allotted presentation time to respect the audience's schedule.
   - Incorporate pauses to allow the audience time to process information.

5. *Q&A Session:*
   - Encourage questions during or at the end of the presentation.
   - Being open to feedback and questions shows engagement and a willingness to help the audience understand the message.

Remember, effective communication is not just about delivering information; it's about building a connection with your audience. Stay authentic, engage your audience, and be responsive to their needs and inquiries.

# Avoiding common errors

**Personal notes:**

*Length:*

- Many presentations suffer from ineffectiveness due to excessive length. Consider the audience's attention span, and exceeding 20 minutes poses the risk of losing their engagement. Allocate time for potential audience questions.

*Purpose:*

- Forgetting to clearly state the presentation's objective in the introduction is a common error. This oversight can hinder the audience's understanding of the findings, diminishing the impact of the story.

*Guide Audience:*

- As speakers, guide the audience by delivering a sequence of information that supports the story and keeps their attention. Instead of saving all findings for the end, integrate them throughout, providing a backbone for the message.

*Audience Involvement:*

- Avoid presenting as a monologue; involve the audience. Begin with a strong introduction, stating who you are and why you're presenting. Clearly declare main assumptions to show empathy. Engage the audience with questions, relate content to the main idea, and maintain their involvement.

*Body Language:*

- The speaker is central to the presentation, so leverage body language for emphasis. Use natural gestures, hand movements, or facial expressions to create emphasis. Positive body language conveys confidence and enhances audience focus.

*Voice Tonality:*

- Utilize voice as a tool. Vary tones to emphasize the message; speak quickly for urgency or excitement, and slowly for significance. Pay attention to intonation; sound engaged and interested, as a lack of enthusiasm can disengage the audience.

Remember, effective presentations require a balance between content, delivery, and audience engagement. Be mindful of these common errors to enhance the impact of your message.
